=============================================================
 
This set of scripts aims to ease the management of the Mozilla l10n environment
and focuses specially on those who use Translate Toolkit.

Package contents
================

This package includes:
 - README : this file you are reading.
 - config.py : main configuration file.
 - update.py : script to update repositories.
 - moz2po.py : creates PO files from the repositories.
 - po2moz.py : converts back PO files to Mozilla l10n formats.
 - bug_diff.py : creates diff based on our changes.
 - compare.py : runs compare-locales for selected products.


Installation
============

Just place all the .py files in your base directory. If you don't have a
repository yet, creating a new directory would make sense.
If you have a working comm-central, mozilla-central, or l10n-central
repository, please make sure your directory layout follows this pattern:

  + basedir/
    - comm-central
    + l10n
      - ab-CD

or in case you have mozilla-central,

  + basedir
    - mozilla-central
    + l10n
      - ab-CD

where comm-central, mozilla-central, and ab-CD are Mercurial repositories.


Configuration
=============

You will need to configure several things before running the scripts.

* Main configuration.
  config.py :

    You will need to set your locale code, the product(s) you are localizing,
    and specify whether you are using comm-central or not.
    You can also customize the parameters passed to moz2po and po2moz commands.

* Global Mercurial configuration.
  $HOME/.hgrc :
    [ui]
    username = Your Real Name <user@example.com>
    merge = your-merge-program

    [diff]
    git = 1

    [defaults]
    diff=-p -U 8

* Before pushing to l10n-central, configure your repository and ssh as well.
  l10n-central/MOZLANG/.hg/hgrc :
    [paths]
    default = http://hg.mozilla.org/l10n-central/MOZLANG
    default-push = ssh://hg.mozilla.org/l10n-central/MOZLANG

  $HOME/.ssh/config :
    Host hg.mozilla.org
    User user@host.domain
